This repo contains InternVideo series and related works in video foundation models.

- [InternVideo](InternVideo1): general video foundation models via generative and discriminative learning
- [InternVideo2](InternVideo2): scaling video foundation models for multimodal video understanding
- [InternVideo2.5](InternVideo2.5): empowering video mllms with long and rich context modeling
- [InternVid](Data/InternVid): a large-scale video-text dataset for multimodal understanding and generation

## Updates
- `2025.01`: [InternVideo2.5](InternVideo2.5) is now released! Check out the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12386) for detailed insights, and access the [model](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL_2_5_HiCo_R16) on HuggingFace.
- `2024.08.12`: We provide smaller models, [InternVideo2-S/B/L](./InternVideo2/single_modality/MODEL_ZOO.md), which are distilled from InternVideo2-1B. We also build smaller [VideoCLIP](./InternVideo2/multi_modality/MODEL_ZOO.md) with MobileCLIP.
- `2024.08`: [InternVideo2-Stage3-8B](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVideo2-Chat-8B) and [InternVideo2-Stage3-8B-HD](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVideo2_chat_8B_HD) are released. 8B indicates the use of InternVideo2-1B and the 7B LLM.
- `2024.07`: The video annotation for InternVid2 ([HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenGVLab/InternVideo2_Vid_Text)) is released.
- `2024.06`: The full version of the video annotation (230M video-text pairs) for InternVid ([OpenDataLab](https://opendatalab.com/shepshep/InternVidFull) | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenGVLab/InternVid-Full)) is released.
- `2024.04`: The [Checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/collections/OpenGVLab/internvideo2-6618ccb574bd2f91410df5cd) and scripts for InternVideo2 are released.
- `2024.03`: The [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15377) of InternVideo2 is released.
- `2024.01`: [InternVid](Data/InternVid) (a video-text dataset for video understanding and generation) has been accepted for spotlight presentation of ICLR 2024.
- `2023.07`: A **video-text dataset InternVid** is released at [here](Data/InternVid) for facilitating multimodal understanding and generation.
- `2023.05`: **Video instruction data** are released at [here](Data/instruction_data) for tuning end-to-end video-centric multimodal dialogue systems like [VideoChat](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Ask-Anything).
- `2023.01`: The [code & models](InternVideo1) of InternVideo are released.
- `2022.12`: The [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03191.pdf) of InternVideo is released.
- `2022.09`: Press releases of InternVideo ([official](https://www.shlab.org.cn/news/5443279) | [163 news](https://www.163.com/dy/article/HG939TNR0530QRMB.html) | [qq news](https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20220902A053JP00)).
